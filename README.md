## How to Install All Shaders at once?

- Be sure that you have [Modtools](https://github.com/promod/CoD4-Mod-Tools) properly installed.
- Copy and Paste whole `raw/` folder to `cod4/raw/`
- Go to `cod4/raw/shader_bin/shader_src/` and run `compile.bat`

> You should now be able to use those materials in your mod/map.
